**Lay Abstract:** Inflammatory bowel diseases are a growing global health concern and there is a need to understand how bacteria associated with gut inflammation, such as Bacteroides fragilis, adapt to and survive in the inflamed gut environment. In this study, we examined how two enzymes that produce cardiolipin, a class of membrane lipids, contribute to the survival of a clinical isolate of B. fragilis under gut-relevant stress conditions. We provide evidence that these cardiolipin synthases produce chemically distinct cardiolipin products and demonstrate that B. fragilis remodels its membrane to compensate for the absence of cardiolipins.

**Abstract:** Bacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic resident of the human gut known to tolerate the toxic effects of host-produced and microbially-modified bile acids. Two putative cardiolipin synthases, ClsA and ClsB, have been implicated in B. fragilis bile acid tolerance, but their specific functions and roles in Bacteroides cell physiology remain undefined. Although conserved across Bacteroides species, ClsA and ClsB are phylogenetically distinct from the well-characterized cardiolipin synthases found in Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Here, we show that ClsA and ClsB have different cardiolipin synthase activities and make non-redundant contributions to B. fragilis fitness under gut-relevant stress conditions, including osmotic stress, disruption of membrane potential, and exposure to the bile acid deoxycholate. While deoxycholate perturbs B. fragilis K⁺/Na⁺ homeostasis, deletion of clsA and clsB did not significantly alter intracellular ion levels, as measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, suggesting that these enzymes do not directly modulate ion balance. High resolution mass spectrometry-based lipidomic analyses show that cardiolipin comprises less than 1% of B. fragilis membranes and that ClsA and ClsB produce distinct cardiolipin products with unique acyl chain lengths and levels of unsaturation. Deletion of either cls gene led to Cls-specific remodeling of the B. fragilis envelope lipid content, which was associated with shifts in non-lipid metabolites indicative of stress-induced metabolism changes. These results demonstrate distinct roles for ClsA and ClsB in shaping B. fragilis membrane composition and stress responses, and provide new insights into how bile acids impact the physiology of a common member of the gut microbiota.
