Abstract: *Bacteroides fragilis* is a nanaerobic resident of the human gut and must survive the toxic effects of bile acids. Through a barcoded-transposon sequencing screen, we identified two cardiolipin synthases, which we named ClsA and ClsB, as important fitness factors to *B. fragilis* under bile acid stress. These two enzymes are conserved across the Bacteroides but phylogenetically distinct from the Cls proteins from other bacterial phyla. Deletion of either cls gene resulted in loss of growth fitness under membrane-, osmotic- and ionophore-based stresses. While exposure to deoxycholate and ionophores perturbed certain intracellular elements, *cls* loss largely did not change the amount of elements as determined by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Using LC-MS/MS, we found that each Cls protein has different cardiolipin products, with unique acyl chain lengths and unsaturation levels. Furthermore, deletion of either gene resulted in Cls-specific remodeling of the *B. fragilis* envelope. Altogether, we demonstrate that the homologous *B. fragilis* cardiolipin synthases are functionally non-redundant.
